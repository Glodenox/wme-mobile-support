# WME Mobile Support

This userscript augments the [Waze Map Editor](https://www.waze.com/editor/) by providing additional styling for mobile devices. At the moment the aim is just to allow for mobile changes when you are provided a permalink by another community member.

## How to use

![WME Mobile Support login screen](https://tomputtemans.com/waze-scripts/images/wme-mobile-support-1.jpg)

This script requires a mobile browser that allows for extensions such as TamperMonkey to be added. Chrome for mobile currently doesn't allow extensions, but Firefox Mobile does.

## Installation instructions

If you have a browser installed on your mobile device that supports extensions, make sure you have [TamperMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) installed. The menu list should now contain a TamperMonkey option.

For WME Mobile Support you should be able to install the script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/39641-wme-mobile-support). There will be a big green install button which you will have to press to install the script.

After installing a userscript, you will be able to find it working on the site(s) specified. Do note that if you had the page open before installing the userscript, you will probably first need to refresh the page.

TamperMonkey will occasionally check for new versions of these scripts. You will get a notification when a new version has been found and installed.
